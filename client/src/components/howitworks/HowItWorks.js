				<h2>How crowdfunded cinema works</h2>
				<p>
				ourscreen allows film fans to watch the films they love at their local cinema, whether thatâ€™s a cult classic, foreign thriller or modern masterpiece.
Fans can start by creating their own screening, or by booking tickets to screenings hosted by others. Our crowdsourced model means that as long as enough people book tickets, the screening will go ahead.
For first-time hosts or first-time ticket buyers, this page is designed to help you navigate the waters to creating a screening and booking a ticket. Our hosts held over 500 screenings last year, but it always helps to have Hooper driving the boat.
